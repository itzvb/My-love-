My Love, Ruchika ❤️

I just want to remind you how much I love you 💖. No matter what happens, no matter how much we fight or have our little disagreements, you are always the one for me 💑. There will be days when we don’t talk much, and that’s okay because our love is beyond just words. It’s a feeling, a connection, something that stays strong no matter what! 💞

And guess what? We’ll meet soon in person! 🤗 I can't wait to see you, hold you close, and just be with you. Until then, remember that my love for you never fades 🌙✨.

I love you so much, Ruchika! 💕 Always and forever! 💖💫
